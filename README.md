# About our Project
## Purpose
The pupose of this project is to use our culimated skills with object oriented programming, and to create a full Pacman game. We intend to use classes and inheritance for the majority of this project.

## Reflection
Our first plan was to break down everything and sketched everything out so we can split up the work. After we discussed on who's doing what, Dane made the whole map and how Pacman can detect collision. Making the whole map was hard since we had to figure out what values are for rows and collumns and how to implent that on where to place it on the screen. Detecting the collision was a bit harder because detecting where a object is a bit harder since there are multiple object all over the screen and pacman has to detect if it can collide or not. Jasper made the pacman and ghost and how it also detects. Making the pacman was a bit easier than normal since we did it last year so we used that code and put it into a object, then we had to detect pacman if it is inside a object or touch an object. Making the ghost and the functions of it was also difficult because it was the same thing as the pacman; detecting the objects around it and what made it worse was that making the algorithms were different for each ghost and finding the best way possible to go to pacman.
